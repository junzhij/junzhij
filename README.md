## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Junzhi, A high school student comes from Chengdu.

### Start from study

Honestly, I feel that I'm not talented in computer science, -- but I just like it --. So subjects like math, Chienese, physics etc. are my major.

Everything about tech can make me exciting, especially Apple.

Coming soon!!!
